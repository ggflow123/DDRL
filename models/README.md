# Model Placing Folder

Put the teacher models in this directory to perform distillation, and student models over here to perform evaluation.

Teacher models trained are available at **[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ggfly/DD4RL-procgen-teachermodels/tree/main)**.

The code for teacher model training are highly dependent on this **[repo](https://github.com/lerrytang/train-procgen-pfrl/blob/main).**
